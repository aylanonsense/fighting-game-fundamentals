					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-offense-2.gif" width="192" height="284" />

					<p>If blocked, you can start another attack <strong class="blockstun">20</strong> - <strong>27</strong> = <strong>-7</strong> frames <em>after</em> your opponent&mdash;this is called <strong class="vocab">frame <em>disadvantage</em></strong></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Attacking your opponent</h3>
					<p>An attack that gives frame advantage is "<strong class="vocab">safe on block</strong>"</p>

				</section>

					<h3>Attacking your opponent</h3>
					<p>Remember to mix low attacks, overhead attacks, and throws into your assault to catch your opponent off guard</p>
					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-offense-4.gif" width="723" height="345" />

					<p><strong>Goal:</strong> gain an advantage for yourself</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>The neutral game is extremely complex because both players have all options open to them</p>
					<p>So what do you do?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Properly spacing yourself is <strong>CRITICAL</strong></p>
					<p>At long range none of your attacks will reach each other</p>
					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-neutral-2.gif" width="356" height="328" />
					<p>At short range all of them will</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>In-between those two extremes interesting stuff happens</p>
					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-neutral-3.gif" width="336" height="513" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Cammy (left) has a long-range kick that outranges all of Guile's (right) normal moves</p>
					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-neutral-4.gif" width="470" height="260" />
					<p>She might try to abuse this by staying right at that range</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>If Guile moves just outside of that range, he can <strong class="vocab">bait</strong> her into using an attack that will <spna class="vocab">whiff</spna> (miss)</p>
					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-neutral-5.gif" width="490" height="260" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Because of the extended <span class="hurtbox">hurtbox</span> from her attack, Guile can counterattack and <span class="vocab">punish</span> from where he is</p>
					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-neutral-6.gif" width="505" height="260" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Cammy might respond by moving extra close to make sure Guile can't get away, but then he is in range to hit her</p>
					<img src="/img/cammy-guile-neutral-7.gif" width="404" height="328" />
					<p>This back-and-forth of spacing is called <strong class="vocab">footsies</strong></p>
				</section>

				<!-- TODO SPOT 3 footsies -->

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>If you are able to dominate the footsies game you can start <strong class="vocab">zoning</strong> your opponent (deciding where they stand)</p>
					<img src="/img/dhalsim-stand.gif" width="160" height="296" />
					<p>In most fighting games there is a character built specifically for this aspect of the game, called <strong class="vocab">zoners</strong></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Zoners rely on <strong class="vocab">pokes</strong> to deal damage and control space</p>
					<img src="/img/dhalsim-attack.gif" width="540" height="168" />
					<p>These moves will never combo, but they make it incredibly hard for the opponent to get anywhere close to retaliate</p>
					<p>Most characters have a couple of good pokes</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Projectiles are a particularly potent at zoning</p>
					<p>They move independent of your character</p>
					<img src="/img/hadoken.gif" width="144" height="96" />
					<p>They cover a lot of ground and meanwhile you can take other actions to zone your opponent (like more projectiles!)</p>
				</section>

				<!-- TODO SPOT 2 projectiles -->

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Moves that are good at zoning are usually bad at short range</p>
					<p>Instead of zoning your opponent, you can just try to get up close and personal as fast as possible</p>
					<img src="/img/feilong-stand.gif" width="138" height="240" />
					<p>Again, most fighting games have characters who specialize in closing the distance as fast as possible and staying there, called <strong class="vocab">rushdown</strong> characters</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The neutral game</h3>
					<p>Because both players have everything at their disposal, the neutral game is varied and matchup-dependent</p>
					<p>In general:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Find the optimal distance from your opponent</li>
						<li>Punish your opponent's whiffed moves</li>
						<li>Poke from range</li>
						<li>Close the distance if it's advantageous</li>

					<blockquote style="font-size:60%">You know how each character has a life bar? At one point, I wanted to make the power gauge for Chun-Li shorter than for the other characters because women are not as strong. But Nishitani didn't want to do that. We both had legitimate reasons, but then we came to an agreement to not make it shorter.</blockquote>

					<blockquote style="font-size:60%">Chun-Li has big thighs, right? So back in the day, I asked Mr. Yasuda, "Why does she have such big thighs?" And he started shouting and went off and was like, "I can't believe you don't understand the appeal." And he started explaining the attraction. And you know, I'm a woman and I asked the question but it kind of got awkward when he started explaining his fetishes. I mean, he has really strong feelings toward his creations. There's a reason for everything being the way that it is.</blockquote>

					<h3>Some feminism for you</h3>
					<p>The fighting game community is extremely racially diverse</p>
					<img src="/img/audience.jpg" width="500" height="333" />
					<p>... but gender diversity is pretty bad</p>

					<h3>Some feminism for you</h3>
					<p>It's getting better, but it's a problem we need to be aware of</p>
					<p>If someone says weird sexist shit, call them out on it, preferably in a way where they'll listen</p>
					<p>Hold developers accountable</p>
					<p>Be an ally!</p>
